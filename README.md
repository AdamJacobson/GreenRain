# Green Rain
JavaScript project to make "Green Rain" computer code made famous by The Matrix.

This is my first JavaScript project.

Future improvements:
* Characters should fade from white to green then black instead of changing instantly
* ~~Each column should scroll at the same speed but have randomized starting time~~
* Random time between a column finishing and starting again
* Some characters should randomly change not only what the character is, but also the orientation.
* Generate a new random character on appearing instead of just using the static grid of characters.
* ~~Dynamic width so that columns fill the whole screen~~
* Dynamic height so that characters fill the screen entirely
* Find a more suitable font
* Use CSS tricks to make characters appear fuzzy as if shown on an older monitor
