# Matrix-Text
JavaScript project to make scrolling and fading green text made famous by The Matrix.

This is my first JavaScript project.

Future improvements:
* Characters should fade from white to green then black instead of changing instantly
* Each column should scroll at the same speed but have randomized starting time
* Random time between a column finishing and starting again
* Some characters should randomly change not only what the character is, but also the orientation.
* ~~Dynamic width so that columns fill the whole screen~~
* Dynamic height so that characters fill the screen entirely
* Find a more suitable font
* Use CSS tricks to make characters appear fuzzy as if shown on an older monitor
